    "The PERCEIVE project seeks to proactively identify upcoming cybersecurity threats through textual similarity. Social network analysis, however, can be used to partition textual content, and hence serve as social-oriented word selection criteria, for defining corpus' documents. \n",

    "The subject of this notebook, the [Full Disclosure (FD) mailing list](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/) is a \"public, vendor-neutral forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community.\""

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Although cybersecurity email mailing lists provide a rich source to identify emerging concepts, it contains a large amount of content that is irrelevant to the project's purpose, including but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    " * conference invitations[[1](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Feb/6)]\n",
    " * vendor announcements[[2](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Dec/48)]\n",
    " * extensive conversations on security topics[[3](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2004/Jul/1026)]\n",
    " * a significant amount of trolling[[4](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Apr/96)] \n",
    " * and nonsense[[5](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2009/Jul/289)] [[6](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2004/Jul/796)].\n",
    "\n",
    "As some of the irrelevant content can be strictly tied to it's producer, i.e., the **authors** of the **e-mail replies**, Social network analysis provides an interesting opportunity for the isolation of relevant discussion topics in order to **filter** non-related vulnerability content. "

The original csv files are available [online](https://mega.nz/#F!CUEByR5I!GY56GzTpYz68IlTqj4aQNQ!fR8jFLxL). The networks were imported into [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) to create a series of [visualization graphics](\n",

In particular, many of the core functions[[7](https://github.com/jaroslav-kuchar/Social-Network-Analysis/issues/2)] and plugins[[8](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/issues/1481)] once used for social network analysis are not compatible with current (0.9) software versions. Gephi specifications note that the 0.9.0 version (December 2015) \"Removed [the] Clustering module\"[[9](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/releases/tag/v0.9.0)] that these plugins relied upon."

    "[Python-igraph](http://igraph.org/python/) (igraph hereafter) allows a user to import graphs in a variety of file formats, several of which match Gephi's export options. Brief tests demonstrated that the [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) format was most successful for a workflow of transferring networks from Gephi to igraph. (Attempt to import [GML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language) and [Pajek](http://mrvar.fdv.uni-lj.si/pajek/) caused one instance of Python to hang; further investigation would be required to identify a cause.) The following examples use [GraphML files](https://mega.nz/#F!Dpdh2TjD!4Rd462mFXbdFn5Scs1WwUA) exported from Gephi."
