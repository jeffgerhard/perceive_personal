This repository stores data and source images for PERCEIVE developed as an independent study project, spring 2017. 

The draft version of my [final Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jeffgerhard/perceive/blob/master/Notebooks/Full_Disclosure/full_disclosure_introduction.ipynb) is also available.

The accompanying presentation is available on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Zx3x2KeR88). Slides are included in this repo but the notes included are not verbatim.
