    "# Introduction\n",
    "As part of the overall goal of the PERCEIVE project to proactively identify upcoming cybersecurity threats, social network analysis is being used to analyze relevant email lists. The subject of this notebook, the [Full Disclosure (FD) mailing list](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/) is a \"public, vendor-neutral forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community.\"\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Although email networks provide a corpus for analysis and predictive modeling, the actual FD network includes a large amount of content that is irrelevant to the project's purpose. This content includes conference invitations[[1](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Feb/6)], vendor announcements[[2](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Dec/48)], and extensive conversations on security topics[[3](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2004/Jul/1026)]. The list has also included a significant amount of trolling[[4](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Apr/96)] and nonsense[[5](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2009/Jul/289)] [[6](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2004/Jul/796)].\n",
    "\n",
    "Social network analysis will allow for the isolation of relevant discussion topics in order to develop a more accurate sample set for continuing study.\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Earlier in this project, the FD email lists were developed into networks of edges and nodes, divided by year. The original csv files are available [online](https://mega.nz/#F!CUEByR5I!GY56GzTpYz68IlTqj4aQNQ!fR8jFLxL). The networks were imported into [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) to create a series of [visualization graphics](\n",
    "https://mega.nz/#F!btdgFBID!hktkVrhZB5etOBBVLrgTrA).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gephi is useful for visualization, but problematic for analysis. In particular, many of the core functions[[7](https://github.com/jaroslav-kuchar/Social-Network-Analysis/issues/2)] and plugins[[8](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/issues/1481)] once used for social network analysis are not compatible with current (0.9) software versions. Gephi specifications note that the 0.9.0 version (December 2015) \"Removed [the] Clustering module\"[[9](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/releases/tag/v0.9.0)] that these plugins relied upon.\n",
    "## Graph overview\n",
    "In the FD graphs, nodes represent either documents (i.e., emails) or authors. Edges are directed, representing authorship and replies; edge weight indicates an increasing number of replies. In the Gephi graphics, blue nodes represent authors and red nodes represent documents. \n",
    "# Social network analysis in python-igraph\n",
    "## Importing graphs into igraph\n",
    "[Python-igraph](http://igraph.org/python/) (igraph hereafter) allows a user to import graphs in a variety of file formats, several of which match Gephi's export options. Brief tests demonstrated that the [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) format was most successful for a workflow of transferring networks from Gephi to igraph. (Attempt to import [GML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language) and [Pajek](http://mrvar.fdv.uni-lj.si/pajek/) caused one instance of Python to hang; further investigation would be required to identify a cause.) The following examples use [GraphML files](https://mega.nz/#F!Dpdh2TjD!4Rd462mFXbdFn5Scs1WwUA) exported from Gephi."
