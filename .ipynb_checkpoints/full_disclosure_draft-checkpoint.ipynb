    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The [PERCEIVE](https://sailuh.github.io/perceive/) project seeks to proactively identify upcoming cybersecurity threats through textual similarity. Social network analysis can be used to partition a network and evaluate its textual content, and hence provide word-selection criteria for defining corpus documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "The subject of this notebook, the [Full Disclosure (FD) mailing list](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/) is a \"public, vendor-neutral forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Although cybersecurity email mailing lists provide a rich source to identify emerging concepts, they contain a large amount of content that is irrelevant to the project's purpose, including but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    " * conference invitations[[1](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Feb/6)]\n",
    " * vendor announcements[[2](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Dec/48)]\n",
    " * extensive conversations on security topics[[3](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2004/Jul/1026)]\n",
    " * a significant amount of trolling[[4](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Apr/96)] \n",
    " * and nonsense[[5](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2009/Jul/289)] [[6](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2004/Jul/796)].\n",
    "\n",
    "As some of this irrelevant content can be strictly tied to its producer, i.e., the **authors** of the **e-mail replies**, social network analysis provides an interesting opportunity for the isolation of relevant discussion topics in order to **filter** non-related vulnerability content. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Network Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier in this project, the FD email lists were developed into networks of edges and nodes, divided by year. These original csv files are available [online](https://mega.nz/#F!CUEByR5I!GY56GzTpYz68IlTqj4aQNQ!fR8jFLxL). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the FD graphs, nodes represent either documents (i.e., emails) or authors, as identified by a nodeType attribute. Edges are directed, representing authorship and replies; edge weight indicates an increasing number of replies. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools used\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gephi \n",
    "\n",
    "While [Gephi](http://gephi.org/) proved useful for data exploration, some difficulties arose. In particular, many of the core functions[[7](https://github.com/jaroslav-kuchar/Social-Network-Analysis/issues/2)] and plugins[[8](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/issues/1481)] once used for social network analysis are not compatible with current (0.9) software versions. Gephi specifications note that the 0.9.0 version (December 2015) \"Removed [the] Clustering module\"[[9](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/releases/tag/v0.9.0)] that these plugins relied upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python-igraph \n",
    "\n",
    "[Python-igraph](http://igraph.org/python/) (igraph hereafter) allows for programatic manipulation of network data. Igraph can generate images via a `plot` function, but this is a slow process for large graphs. Igraph has a wide variety of import and export options for network data, including straightforward export of subgraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interoperability of Gephi and igraph\n",
    "\n",
    "While Gephi can export graphs, its export implementations include temporary node properties like position and color attributes. Igraph can import Gephi-exported [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) files (and those are available [here](https://mega.nz/#F!Dpdh2TjD!4Rd462mFXbdFn5Scs1WwUA). However, it was more useful in the long run to generate graphs in igraph directly from the provided edge and node lists. Igraph's exported GraphML files functioned as expected in Gephi.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating graphs from edge and node lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Gephi**, graphs were generated via the `\"import spreadsheet\"` function, and [separate Gephi projects](https://github.com/jeffgerhard/perceive_personal/tree/master/gephi_projects) saved for each year. \n",
    "\n",
    "In **igraph**, graphs are generated via importing csv data into lists, then using igraph's `DictReader` function.\n"

    "## The expansion and contraction of Full Disclosure\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear from a quick look at the graphs that the overall pattern of the Full Disclosure network has shifted over time. In the early years of the list, there were tightly clustered conversations, particularly from about 2003-2006. As the years went by, the level of discussion seems to have dropped. Some of this pattern can be inferred simply from the filesizes of the edge and node lists, or by counting the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visual impression is further confirmed by a documented change in the FD network in March, 2014, when one of the original managers of the list decided to halt the list entirely[[11](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Mar/332)] but another team soon revived it[[12](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Mar/333)]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following the 2014 format change, the number of edges drops significantly, and the list displays a different network structure from the earlier years. Currently, the list remains active but few members respond to published posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## \"Firework\" patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual analysis of the graphs for each year showed distinct fireworks patterns throughout the lifecycle of the list. These are cases where one author is posting to the list many times, with little or no response from other people on the list, resulting in a hub-and-spoke graph form. The working hypothesis is that these firework patterns generally represent security advisories. If so, these are discussions known issues, and not useful for the project's overall predictive goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "These fireworks were analyzed both visually, in Gephi, and programatically, in igraph, to test the hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In **Gephi**, manual examination included use of the [Linkfluence plugin](https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/linkfluence-plugin/) to launch URLs in a web browser directly from nodes studied. This node-by-node analysis demonstrated that firework nodes were security advisories[[13](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Sep/310)][[14](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Apr/291)][[15](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Aug/8)].\n",
    "\n",
    "In **igraph**, it was informative to assess each author node and examine the in-degree of its connected (document) nodes. In cases where all (or most) of an author's neighbors have an in-degree of one, the author is the hub of a firework. "

A researcher more familiar with security matters should assess whether or not the Nick FitzGerald messages (for example [[20](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Jan/443)], [[21](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Jan/422)], [[22](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Dec/368)]) are valuable for further study; they are primarily general discussions of security topics, in conversation with a wider group of list members.\n",

The fact that these users are not typical makes analysis difficult. The best practice is to treat them as trolls (n3td3v is referred to as a troll in the cited links, with some caveats.) Conveniently, the blob clustering has linked together all of these troll-flavored postings into one giant subgraph of argumentation and flame wars. (Examples of such posts include [[25](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Dec/200)], [[26](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Jun/104)], [[27](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Oct/65)].)
